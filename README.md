#3D Printed/Laser Cut Bowtie

These are the files need to 3D print a bowtie clip, to be used with a laser-cut or [shudder] scissor-cut craft foam bowtie, as seen in this [lovely video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK6XqXPjCu3/).

##Materials:

* Sheet of craft foam, colour of your choice (1.5mm or 2mm works, size is really up to you)
* Laser cutter (optional)
* Access to 3D printer.  Filament colour/material is up to you.  Only tried PLA, tbh
* Fabric elastic (1cm-ish wide and length is up to you)

##Instructions:

* Laser cut or scissor cut [bowtie_v3.svg](https://github.com/jyounker/bowties/blob/master/bowtie_v3.svg)
    * if you need to modify size/shape, pull [bowtie_components_v3.svg](https://github.com/jyounker/bowties/blob/master/bowtie_components_v3.svg) into Inkscape and have at it
    * line up the cutouts (slots), press/fold the tie
* 3D print [bowtie-clip-v3.stl](https://github.com/jyounker/bowties/blob/master/bowtie-clip-v3.stl)
    * if you need to modify size/shape, pull [bowtie-clip-v3.123dx](https://github.com/jyounker/bowties/blob/master/bowtie-clip-v3.123dx) into 123Design and have at it
* Slip the tie through the clip.  I find that if you 'accordian' fold it and slip it through it looks best
* Add the elastics to the cut-outs on the back of the clip.  You can sew or tie (or glue or tape or staple) the elastic to itself, or knot each end
* Rock your new bowtie!
